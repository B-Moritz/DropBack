        <h2>What's our mission?</h2>
        <p>
          In 2012 Save The Children came in contact with the only teacher at one of their mobile schools in Babile.
          The teacher shared the reasons behind the number of children dropping out.
          Babile is a dry region, which leads to a lot of the students not showing up to school,
          and instead collect water and take care of their families. In other instances, girls down to the age of 14 get
          married before completing their education. Babile is a strip of land in Ethiopia, and in 2007 the
          country had a dropout rate of 60% in primary schools, and many other African countries struggle with the same issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Save the children works towards helping children and securing their education.
          Every year the organization reports children who drop out from schools all around the world.
          They have most of the data, but lack a way to reach the right and influential people who can help resolve this issue.

          <h2>Our Solution</h2>
          <p>
            Dropback is a platform that will collect existing data and visualize it for teachers and
            politicians for preventive use. By using HDX, we can add geographical data to existing attendance and
            enrollment data in developing countries. This will enable Save the Children to detect and understand
            underlying social and economic problems contributing to children dropping out. An example of this would be
            to cross-reference data on food price and availability, with attendance data for students from a given region.
            This would make it possible to intervene earlier to ensure continued enrollment and attendance.
